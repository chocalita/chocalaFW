        <ul>
            <li>
                Pluggable framework architecture that allows request lifecycles to be customized for each action.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hierarchical approach to internationalization that simplifies localizing applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                Supports automatic generation from data base table to classes, handling it on a model layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Supports message translation, date and time formatting, number formatting, and interface localization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Input data can be accepted from a number of sources, currently supported are HTTP GET/POST, email, XML-RPC. SOAP support is anticipated in the near future.
